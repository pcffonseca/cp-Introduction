    "Well actually... a third way has emerged in recent years, and Python and Java actually sit in this \"grey area\" (though PERL does not). Program code can be translated (i.e. compiled) to an intermediate low-level pseudo-code called *bytecode*. This is the choice made in Java and Python (as well as languages of the Microsoft .NET framework, e.g. C#). The interpreter then only needs to convert bytecode to machine code on the fly, but this is a much simpler task. Thus the first advantage of this approach is *increased speed* relative to interpreted languages (though of course bytecode is still slow compared to native code).\n",

    "Object-oriented programming is a technique for facilitating code reuse. It is very popular in industry, though there are arguments against it, as well as in favour. It is essentially an effective way of encapsulating data and code in independent units (known as *objects*) that can be handled without any knowledge of their internal working and modified according to your needs. **Objects** are a more advanced concept than *modules* or *functions* (both of which we will cover), and offer exciting capabilities such as inheritance (in fact, object-oriented libraries are organised in taxonomies of sorts). This obviously imposes some overhead, especially evident in languages like Java (where object-oriented programming is mandatory). \n",
